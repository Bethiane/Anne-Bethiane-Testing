# Electricity Selling App Testing

This project has two many parts: Backend and Frontend

# Quick Start

## Setup

## Backend

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

### 1. Clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/Bethiane/Anne-Bethiane-Testing

```
### 2. Go to the directory

```
cd backend

```
### 3. Add dependencies

```
npm i

```

### Running the app

```
node server.js

```

### Running the tests


```
npm test

```

## Frontend

### Run the app

```
cd frontend
ng serve --open

```

### Running the tests

```
ng test

```
Karma will open a new tab in Chrome and you will see test. Continue debugging

The thing that I am still working on and learning how to use it is Karma. If you clone the project, you will find it. 

The use of Karma made things easy. Go to karma.conf.js


### Enjoy
