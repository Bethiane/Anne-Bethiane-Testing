# Electricity Selling App Testing

This project has two many parts: Backend and Frontend

# Quick Start

## Setup

## Backend

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/Bethiane/Anne-Bethiane-Testing
cd backend
node setup

```
### Running the app

To get the app up and running, run:

```
npm start

```
### Running the tests

Install jest before anything 

```
npm install -g jest

```

Then run the tests

```
npm test

```

## Frontend

Install and configure Angular Js

```
npm install -g @angular/cli

```

And then run the app

```
cd frontend
ng serve --open

```

### Running the tests

```
ng test

```

The thing that I am still working on and learning how to use it is Karma. If you clone the project, you will find it. 

The use of Karma made things easy. Go to karma.conf.js
